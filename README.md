# HiberniaDiscord v2.1.0: Events Update.

Currently preparing for v2.1.1 which will further improve on our dependency injection methods as well as fix any bugs present in 2.1.0

## Installation

Installing and configuring the plugin was made as easy as possible. We are not DiscordSRV. We're aiming to be a more lightweight alternative more aimed at aiding moderation and administration rather than providing two-way communication.

### Prerequisites

As of the time of writing this there are no current external libraries used.

1.  :: Download the latest copy of HiberniaDiscord from the releases page.
2.  :: Move HiberniaDiscord.jar into your plugins folder
3.  :: Restart (Do *Not* Reload) your server to generate the necessary configuration files.
4.  :: Configure the plugin to use your webhook. 

Learn more about creating webhooks  [Here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhook)
## Deployment

We're currently shipping w/ Maven. Feel free to build the source yourself, should you know how. (Cannot Guarentee what's here is ready to be built. Master branch should be fine.)

## Contributing

Feel free to create a fork and submit a pull request, I'll get to it when I can (Which shouldn't be too long, I have nothing better to do with my time.)

If you'd like to create an addon for HiberniaDiscord feel free to do so. I have made a public repository for v2.1.0 upwards. 
```xml
<repository>
	<id>paradaux-repo</id>
	<url>https://dev.hiberniamc.com/repository/paradaux/</url>
</repository>
```

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>co.paradux</groupId>
	<artifactId>HiberniaDiscord</artifactId>
	<version>2.1.0</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```



## Versioning

We're following a very weak versioning system whereby

2.1.0 - Adds Join/Leave webhook events as well as switches to dependency injection
2.0.0 - Rewrite and Overhaul of the entire plugin. Brings maven support.
1.0.0 - is the initial release
X.01 - was a quickly deployed bugfix.
X.1 - is a substantial feature addition
X.0 - is a complete rewrite or finalisation of the plugin.
