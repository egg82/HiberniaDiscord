# HiberniaDiscord v2.0.0: Rewrite.

Development Branch. Please see Master branch for currently functioning releases.

## Installation

Installing and configuring the plugin was made as easy as possible. We are not DiscordSRV. We're aiming to be a more lightweight alternative more aimed at aiding moderation and administration rather than providing two-way communication.

### Prerequisites

As of the time of writing this there are no current external libraries used.

1.  :: Download the latest copy of HiberniaDiscord from the releases page.
2.  :: Move HiberniaDiscord.jar into your plugins folder
3.  :: Restart (Do *Not* Reload) your server to generate the necessary configuration files.
4.  :: Configure the plugin to use your webhook.

## Deployment

Currently, we are using no build tools or dependency management. This is set to change in the near future as we endorse Maven.

## Contributing

Feel free to create a fork and submit a pull request, I'll get to it when I can (Which shouldn't be too long, I have nothing better to do with my time.)

## Versioning

We're following a very weak versioning system whereby

1.0 - is the initial release
X.01 - was a quickly deployed bugfix.
X.1 - is a substantial feature addition
X.0 - is a complete rewrite or finalisation of the plugin.
